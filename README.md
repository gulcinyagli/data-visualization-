# ðŸ“Š Data Visualization Projects

This folder contains both static and interactive visualizations created using Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Subfolders

- `static-visuals/`: Matplotlib and Seaborn-based static plots for data exploration and reporting.

These visualizations are built with public datasets and demonstrate my ability to communicate insights effectively through visual tools.
